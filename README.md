# Unit 1 Code Refactor

## Description

The purpose of the code refactor challenge was to explore and ensure that the Horiseon websites codebase met all accessibility standards.  By doing this, the website will be optimized for search engines.    

There were several elements missing including alt attributes and semantic HTML.  There were also styling and ordering issues to address.  The site was missing a title and links for better navigation through the page.  

By examining the codebase, reading articles on accessibility standards, and implementing new code I was able to ensure that Horiseon's site follows current accessbility standards and additionally, the links and CSS flow are improved (Scout's Honor). 

I learned what accessbility standards are and how to write the code for those.  I learned how to identify and label semantic HTML.  I learned the importance of regularly committing my work through git work flow.
